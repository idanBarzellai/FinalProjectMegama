# WEFA: Water Earth Fire and Air

WEFA is a 3D third-person shooter free-for-all game created as a final project for the BSc CS degree. The game features four different characters, each with unique skills and movements. The game is built on Unity and uses the Photon Unity Plugin for multiplayer functionality. All animations and models are handcrafted, and an automatic hexagon tiled map with special tiles has been designed. Some of these tiles will damage players, some will create damage over time effects, and some will buff or debuff player movement speed, etc.

## Technologies

- Unity
- Photon Unity Networking Plugin (PUN).
- Handcrafted animations and models.
- Hexagon tiled map with special tiles.

## Gameplay

The game features four different characters, each with unique skills and movements. Every round each player chooses their character's element, and no two elements will be the same (picking an element will lock this specific element for other players in the room). You search for a room to join three other players. You will face each other until the last man standing. When dying, you can roll around and spectate the game until the winner is decided (the next round).

### Fire

Provides the player with a unique speed boost and creates a wall of flame behind it.

### Earth

A click and hold skill where the player can aim an arc and, upon release, leap forward, causing area of effect damage to players near them.

### Air

A leap upwards that knocks enemies back and provides the player with the ability to temporarily fly.

### Water

A click and hold skill where a large vertical tsunami that pushes players it touches is formed. If the player holds, they can ride that wave forward. Letting go will stop them from riding the wave.
